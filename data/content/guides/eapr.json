    "Combine pages into a single PDF per document where possible (avoid multiple uploads for one requirement).",
    "Scan in grayscale at a reasonable DPI (e.g., 150–200) to keep file sizes practical while maintaining legibility.",
    "Flatten and reduce PDF size using 'Save as Reduced Size PDF' or equivalent before upload.",
    "Ensure names and dates are clearly visible; avoid cropped or skewed scans.",
    "Keep filenames meaningful (e.g., work_ref_ABC_Ltd_2019-2022.pdf)."
